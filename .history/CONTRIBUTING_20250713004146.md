# Contributing to Version-Aware Pre-commit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Version-Aware Pre-commit system! This project aims to make code quality a journey, not a destination.

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

We believe that:
- **Code quality should be progressive** - start lenient, grow strict
- **Developers should be guided, not overwhelmed** - learn best practices gradually
- **Version numbers should reflect maturity** - both features and quality standards
- **Automation should be intelligent** - adapt to your project's needs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pre-commit
- git

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd version-aware-precommit

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## 📝 How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Test with different version numbers to ensure the system works correctly

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Test the version checker
python scripts/precommit_version_checker.py

# Test with different versions
sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "0.1.0"/' pyproject.toml
pre-commit run --all-files

sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "1.0.0"/' pyproject.toml
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 4. Submit Your Changes
1. Commit your changes with a clear message
2. Push to your fork
3. Create a Pull Request

## 🎨 Code Style

This project uses the version-aware pre-commit system itself! The strictness depends on the version in `pyproject.toml`:

- **0.1.x**: Basic syntax and security checks
- **0.5.x**: + Type checking
- **0.9.x**: + Docstring and style checks
- **1.0+**: All checks, strict mode

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=scripts

# Test the demo script
./demo.sh
```

### Testing Different Versions
```bash
# Test very lenient
sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "0.1.0"/' pyproject.toml
pre-commit run --all-files

# Test very strict
sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "1.0.0"/' pyproject.toml
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 📚 Documentation

### Adding Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update examples if needed
- Consider adding to the demo script

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Explain the "why" behind design decisions
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- Version of the system you're using
- Version number in your pyproject.toml
- Steps to reproduce the issue
